# Python Mini Projects

This repository will serve as a collection of my Python mini projects and exercises. The goal is to showcase different Python skills, starting from basic exercises to more advanced projects over time. 

### Possibilities for Projects:
- **Basic Python Exercises**: Loops, conditionals, functions, etc.
- **CLI Applications**: Simple command-line tools and games (e.g., number guessing game, to-do list manager)
- **Web Scraping**: Extracting data from websites.
- **API Projects**: Building or consuming APIs.
- **Data Science Projects**: Basic data analysis and visualization with libraries like Pandas and Matplotlib.

## 🧠 Skills Practiced

- Control Flow: Loops, conditionals
- Functions: Creating and using functions
- Data Structures: Lists, dictionaries, sets
- Algorithms: Basic problem solving
